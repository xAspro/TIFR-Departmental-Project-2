The project derives the analytical Fourier domain inspiral template for spinning binaries in eccentric orbits. 
The code which does this is the 1.5PN_Ecc_Expansion.nb and 1.5PN_waveform.nb 
The final_Alphai_And_Phii_RAW.txt matches with the results given in Yunes (2009). The 1.5PN\ htilde.txt file has the full expansion for the waveform in the Fourier domain. The other two text files, are with further simplication, by taking the angles to be 0. 
On top of all these, the expressions look daunting. I will later need to look at if the expressions can be simplified. For now, these text files are just for showing the end result. One can reproduce the same by running the mathematica code, or by using the Final_Alphai_And_Phii_RAW.txt as mentioned in the literature to reproduce the same results.
